/*A power of 2 means a number like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ... where only one bit is set in binary.
The trick:
n & (n - 1) == 0 â†’ This is true only for powers of 2.
Example=
8  ->  1000 (binary)
7  ->  0111 (binary)
8 & 7 -> 0000  (so 8 is a power of 2)
We also check n > 0 because negative numbers and 0 are not powers of 2.
