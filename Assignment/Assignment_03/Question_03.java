/*Why is 25 the Second Largest Instead of 30?
The largest number is always updated first.
If a number is bigger than the current largest, it becomes the new largest, and the old largest moves to secondLargest.
When 30 is found, the previous largest (20) moves to secondLargest.
When 25 is found, it is bigger than secondLargest (20), so it replaces it. */
